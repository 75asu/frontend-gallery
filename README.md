# frontend-gallery

- I am following a learning method to get better at basic frontend(HTML/CSS/JS). 
- I follow many tutorials and blogs to build very tiny projects using Go, will be following this method until I get better at this language in depth. 
- This repo contains 40projects which I have built in 40days 
 

> Live demo of all of them can be seen - [here](https://port.measutosh.repl.co/JSprojects.html)
